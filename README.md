# A Stock Recording and Search Application

Stock Watch is a full stack web application developed with Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

This application allows users to track and manage their personal stock portfolio, and access real-time stock prices and historical data for US stocks.

I utilised the Alpha Vantage API to request stock prices and historical data, which I then use to build charts and display the latest stock prices. Additionally, I use Marketaux API to provide users with the latest news on a list of companies, helping them stay informed about market trends and developments.

Users can sign up and log in to access their personalized stock holdings, and user permissions are tracked using json web tokens.

## Languages and Frameworks

- Javascript, HTML, CSS
- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Deployment

This application was deployed using netlify for the client and heroku for the server.

## Challenges

Given the limitations of the API requests I was not able to show the current price of each stock and determine the current profit or loss as the API requests would been exceed.

## Next Steps

I would like to incorporate a crypto holdings section as well similar to the stocks. Again API request limits may cause issues.
